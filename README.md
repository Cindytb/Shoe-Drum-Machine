# Shoe-Drum-Machine
Digital Electronics project programmed in C++ for arduino

This utilizes: </br>
  1) three FSRs mapped to velocity-scalable MIDI notes </br>
  2) 16 key touch capacitave keypad with 1 being a tap tempo, 2-12 being pre-set drumbeats, 13-15 as fills, and 16 as a clear </br>
  3) 6 knob potentiometers mapped to velocities </br>
  4) 1 ribbon slide potentiometer </br>
  5) 1 SPDT switch </br>
 
Final_Project_AD incorporates MIDI mapping for the Addictive Drums Suite, while Final_Project has standard MIDI mappings
